# Dog-Breed-Classifier
A classifier for detecting dog breeds based on transfer learning.

## Description
This project is originated from Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Project 2. It gives a baseline of Dog Breeds Detecting using transfer learning. The training labeled data is credited to ImageNet while the pretrained network baseline is from Resnet50. I added a basic CNN structure taking bottleneck features from Resnet50 as input, without performing rigorous hyerparameter tuning and finally got around 80% accuracy on training set. Apparantly, such cursory version of Dog Breeds Detecting can be significantly improved through further experimenting and works.
